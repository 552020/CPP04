### 1. The `override` Keyword and `virtual` Keyword in C++98

- **`override` Keyword**: The `override` keyword was introduced in C++11 and is not part of the C++98 standard. Its purpose is to indicate that the function is intended to override a virtual function in the base class. In C++98, you simply declare the function in the derived class without the `override` specifier. Although you can't use `override` in C++98, it's still a good practice to ensure that the function signatures match exactly between the base and derived classes to achieve overriding behavior.
- **Marking as `virtual`**: In C++, once a function is declared as `virtual` in the base class, it is implicitly virtual in any derived class that overrides it. It's not wrong to explicitly mark the overridden function as `virtual` in the derived class, but it's not necessary for the overriding to occur. It can be used for clarity, indicating to readers that the function is virtual and may be overridden in further derived classes. So, while the `virtual` keyword in the derived class's function declaration is optional, it's not incorrect and does not affect the overriding behavior.

### 2. Calling the Copy Assignment Operator of `Animal` in `Cat`

- **Meaning**: When you explicitly call the base class's copy assignment operator in the derived class's assignment operator, you're ensuring that the base class portion of the derived class object is properly copied. This step is crucial for correct object copying, especially when the base class contains dynamically allocated memory or other resources that need to be handled carefully.

- **Current Implementation**: The current implementation does not explicitly call the base class's copy assignment operator. It should be done to ensure that all base class attributes are correctly copied before copying or setting derived class-specific attributes. Here's how it can be corrected:

```cpp
Cat &Cat::operator=(const Cat &source) {
    if (this != &source) {
        Animal::operator=(source); // Correctly call base class assignment operator
        // No need to set 'type' here if it's already set in the constructor
        std::cout << "Cat assignment operator called" << std::endl;
    }
    return *this;
}
```

- **Is It Wrong?**: The initial explanation mentioned calling the base class assignment operator but did not show it explicitly in the code snippet. Not calling it is not inherently "wrong" if the base class has trivial copying behavior (e.g., only simple types or no resources that require deep copying). However, explicitly calling the base class's assignment operator is a best practice, especially in complex class hierarchies, to ensure all parts of an object are correctly managed during assignment.

In summary, for C++98 compatibility, you would not use `override`, but you can still mark overridden methods as `virtual` for clarity. It's also recommended to call the base class's copy assignment operator in the derived class's assignment operator to ensure proper copying of the base class portion of the object.
